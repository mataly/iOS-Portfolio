iOS Development Portfolio for Mataly Claon

# Introduction

My name is Mataly Claon and I am a senior at Eden Prairie High School. I was first introduced to coding by the class AP Computer Science Principles, where I developed a persistent passion for coding. Before taking iOS Development, I started learning both Python and Ruby through CodeAcademy as a hobby. I'm ambitious (almost to a fault) and gritty. I have opened this portfolio as a way to share my progress throughout iOS Development and upload applications I have written. 

# Portfolio Overview

iOS Development has served as the ultimate challenge to my coding ego. The class is structured with a very hands-off, do it yourself approach. The teacher hands you the expansive application building software xCode and says "figure it out." I personally found this awesome, as I was the one who set the pace for my learning throughout the term. Figuring out how to use xCode and how to write Swift didn't involve any lectures, or presentations. It involved getting your hands dirty and figuring out what worked best for you. True guerilla style coding.

When my quiz app, "Narcissism!" didn't pan out quite the way I'd hoped, I pivoted to a new app called "CompanyBot!", a companion bot to help those suffering cabin fever during the Quarantine. Throughout the second term I hope to make various improvements to CompanyBot, including graphics, mini games to entertain, resources linking to mental health organizations and notifications holding virus and quarantine related updates. I want to use this app to build my skills as a developer on all fronts. 

# Coding Experience and Languages

I am somewhat experienced in Python and Ruby, as well as xCode. I am skilled in HTML and Javasript. I am proficient in Java and have a beginner's level understanding of Bash/Shell.

# Future Areas of Interest

I hope to raise my understanding of Bash and Java, as well as xCode. I also plan to learn C# from my mother in the next couple years (she's a software engineer).
