2019-2020 Portfolio for Mataly Claon

Introduction

My name is Mataly Claon and I am a senior at Eden Prairie High School. I was first introduced to coding by the class AP Computer Science Principles, where I developed a persistent passion for coding. Before taking iOS Development, I started learning both Python and Ruby through CodeAcademy as a hobby.
